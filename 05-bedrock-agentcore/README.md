# Part 05: Amazon Bedrock AgentCore - Enterprise AI Agents at Scale

> **Part of the "Building Applied AI Systems" Blog Series**  
> Learn to build production-ready AI systems step by step, from basic RAG to enterprise deployment.

Learn how to leverage Amazon Bedrock AgentCore to build, deploy, and operate robust AI agents at enterprise scale. This post shows you how to transition from prototype agents to production-ready systems with minimal infrastructure overhead.

## 🎯 What is Amazon Bedrock AgentCore?

Amazon AgentCore is a new managed service from AWS (part of Amazon Bedrock) designed to help enterprises build, deploy, and operate robust AI agents at scale using any agentic framework or foundation model—whether inside or outside the Bedrock ecosystem.

### Key Enterprise Benefits

- **Production-Ready Deployment**: Rapid transition from prototype to enterprise-scale AI agents
- **Framework/Model Agnostic**: Works with CrewAI, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, Strands Agents, etc.
- **Robust Tools & Extensibility**: Seamlessly integrates existing APIs and AWS Lambda functions
- **Memory and Personalization**: Persistent, context-aware memory without infrastructure management
- **Enterprise Security**: Strong session isolation, identity management, granular permissions
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Agent-specific tracing, debugging, and real-time performance dashboards
- **Faster Time-to-Value**: Eliminates infrastructure complexity, accelerates ROI

## 🏗️ What You'll Build

This tutorial will guide you through:

1. **Setting up AgentCore**: Configure the managed service environment
2. **Agent Development**: Build multi-agent systems with persistent memory
3. **Tool Integration**: Connect existing APIs and Lambda functions as agent tools  
4. **Security Configuration**: Implement identity management and access controls
5. **Monitoring Setup**: Configure observability and performance tracking
6. **Production Deployment**: Scale agents across enterprise workloads

## 🚀 Getting Started
